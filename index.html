    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks?</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">Here's a small list, as presented in our module:</p>

    <ul style=“list-style-type:square”>
    <li><b>Sanitization of data</b></li>

    <p>Ensuring that the data a system accepts is in the right format. </p>

    <li><b>Secure authorization and authentication</b></li>

    <p>This involves ensuring that authorization and authentication are hard to crack. Best achieved by using an open-standard authorization protocol or framework such as OneLogin, Okta, etc.</p>

    <li><b>Make use of a well-known third-party application</b></li>
    <p>Make sure that the application is tested, and to be trusted. A good way to do that is to check how many downloads the application gets per week.</p>

    <li><b>Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration (CI/CD)</b></li>

    <p>You can read more about what this is <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3271126/what-is-cicd-continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery-explained.html"><b>here</b></a>.</p>

    <li><b>Network security </b></li>

    <p> Network security is the act of protecting the exchange of packets of data across the network. A network engineer is the one responsible for network security</p>

    <li><b>Implementation of automatic user timeout</b></li>

    <p>This involves protecting users who have left their credentials hanging in the browser for a long time. In most cases, this would be done by the backend team by setting a session for the expiration of the user credentials.</p>
